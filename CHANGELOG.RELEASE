[New] sysconfig support through '/etc/sysconfig/maldet'  or '/etc/default/maldet', system dependant, to 
      allow easier configuration overrides; all conf.maldet and internals.conf variables supported
[Change] file stat calls replaced with function file_stat
[Change] stat calls are now (Free|Net)BSD compatible through file_stat function
[Change] report listing, '-e|--report list', now displays scan run time
[Change] scan reports and cli outputs once again display simplified path definitions instead of expanded paths
[Change] unified all clamav selection logic for data paths, running clamd processes, clam(d)scan CLI options etc...
         into a single function, clamselector(); this will make clam behavior more predictable across all functions
[Change] added subdomains path for ISPConfig to cron.daily
[Change] corrected variable naming semantics for import_*_(md5|hex)_url paramters
[Change] monitor mode now identifies inotifywait processes based on a string pattern unique to maldet
         to avoid conflicts with any other inotifywait processes

[Change] normalize installation path variable between LMD proper and installation scripts
[Change] reduced redundant path definitions
[Change] added test for main.cvd and main.cld in determining clamav signature paths
[Change] README changes to reflect new cron customization setup

[Change] scan.tpl reporting template handles column spacing on filenames with spaces better
[Change] CLI usage semantics of --include-regex and --exclude-regex now consistently passing to 'find' command
[Change] moved all internal field separator line break modifications to lbreakifs()
[Change] quarantine .info file is now field separated with colon symbol (:)
[Change] quarantine .info file value ordering has been modified
         # owner:group:mode:size(b):md5:atime(epoch):mtime(epoch):ctime(epoch):file(path)
[Change] record_hits() now writes file mode and file times (a|m|c) into hits history file
[Change] 'eval' is now used as a prefix on the 'find' command to better handle the complex set of options passed to 'find'
         and avoid globbing, splitting and other bash'esque semantic issues
[Change] modified mkpubpaths cronjob to execute every 5 minutes instead of 10
[Change] public mode scanning errors are now more verbose
[Change] updated README to reflect required modsec >=2.9 variable 'SecTmpSaveUploadedFiles'
         for upload scanning
[Change] hookscan.sh (modsec.sh) now checks for variable override file at conf.maldet.hookscan
[Change] added use of sed flag -E for FreeBSD compatibility with GNU sed usage
[Change] clamscan will now respect scan_max_filesize value instead of hardcoded 5M
[Change] default scan_max_filesize increased from 768k to 2048k
[Change] clamscan max-scansize for archive depth set as scan_max_filesize*2
[Fix] improved special character argument escaping for -a|-r options that could have caused arbitrary command
      executions in environments where LMD was allowed to be called by non-root users and/or set-uid/gid wrappers
[Fix] FreeBSD calls to 'md5 -q' were being incorrectly escaped causing file names to never pass and return valid
      md5 hash string; corrected by preprending 'eval' to the md5 command callouts.
[Fix] corrected typo with import_* variables causing configuration imports to fail
[Fix] suppress eout() output for certain import_*() and get_remote_file() calls; this was causing
      false-positive hits for modsec integration
[Fix] install.sh may not have preserved certain variables on upgrade
[Fix] clamdscan was running as a non-root user, would generate lstat errors for all file find results
      leading to potential false positive hit/quarantine
[Fix] the permissions of the $tmpdir path can cause clamd when running as a non-root user to fail on
      startup due as a result of lstat errors on the custom user signature files stored under $tmpdir
[Fix] clamd.conf configurations containing Follow(File|Directory)Symlinks set to false results in
      the rfxn.*/lmd.user.* links causing clamd startup failures
[Fix] suppress error output to cli for customer user signature files when they do not exist
[Fix] uninstall.sh now cleans up signature files from clamav data paths
[Fix] corrected invalid matching against clamdscan binary when clamd was running as non-root user
[Fix] intofiywait on Ubuntu12 doesn't support the '-o' and '-d' option; modified to send stdout to logfile
      for better compatibility
[Fix] conditionally test for vz container and disable use of ionice which is not support in vz containers
[Fix] '-k|--kill-monitor' would under certain circumstances leave zombie processes
[Fix] monitor_cycle() could lead to memory depletion due to infinite loop cycle calls
[Fix] uninstall.sh was not shutting off monitor mode on uninstall
[Fix] legacy variable suppress_cleanhit references updated to email_ignore_clean
[Fix] email alerting broke during an iterative update due to order of precedence change of how configuration
      files were loaded and compatibility (legacy) variables being set before main conf.maldet was loaded;
      caused by FHS refactoring
[Fix] installation upgrade configuration importer was not properly executing after FHS refactoring during an
      iterative update
[Fix] issue #167 certain variables not being preserved on importconf execution, updated 'compat.conf'
[Fix] custom signature runtime files could grow exponentially in monitor mode
[Fix] make '--mkpubpaths' option cross-platform compatible (debian, rh, bsd)
[Fix] replaced usage of 'awk' on file name sensitive variables with 'cut' and/or better scoped field separator for awk
[Fix] double quote wrapped file name variables properly on restore*() functions
[Fix] quarantine .info files were not properly recording source file atime,mtime,ctime values manual quarantine calls
[Fix] user supplied paths to CLI are now better handled if they contain special characters
[Fix] multiple user supplied paths to CLI would generate an error if the first path contained a space and 
      subsequent paths did not
[Fix] commit c8a1279 introduced bug where clamav could be fed zero sized signature files resulting in fatal exit
[Fix] public mode scanning will now properly error if mkpubpaths paths do not exist
[Fix] hookscan.sh (modsec.sh) will now default to not using clamav if clamd is not running
[Fix] though functional, public mode scanning would result in permission errors on console due to pathing issues with
      history tracking files
[Fix] clam(d)scan was not respecting values in 'ignore_sigs' file, this has been corrected for both CLI and monitor mode
[Fix] addition of prefixing eval to find command required certain values to be escaped differently for proper function
      of '-r|--recent'
[Fix] util-linux 2.23 supports 'column' command with '-o' but earlier versions do not, resulting in scan reports
      generating empty hit lists
[Fix] importconf was setting invalid vars for custom signature imports; correct variables are import_custsigs_md5_url
      and import_custsigs_hex_url
[Fix] multiplying maldet monitor processes due to 'ps' command expansion under parent bash process on CentOS6
[Fix] added default installation path to ignore_inotify to prevent monitor looping when '/' is scoped into
      monitoring mode; results in notify log filling disk space
[Fix] importconf was not importing the value for import_config_url
